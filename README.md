# Lean Formalisation of IA Analysis I

This is my Lean formalisation of the First Year Real Analysis Course at the
University of Cambridge.

Note that the statements of lemmas are written in terms of filters. Often I will
write a statement using filters, but the prove them using standard epsilon-N or
epsilon-delta arguments. The reason for stating them in terms of filters is to
be able to use the lemmas already within the library.
